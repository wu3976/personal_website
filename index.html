        <div>Hi!</div>
        <div id="selfintro">
            My name is Chenjie Wu. I am a graduate student of USC Computer Science.
            I have solid understanding and experience in data structure and
algorithms, computer organization, operating system, database system, computer vision, computer networks, 
etc. I also gained decent C++ foundation and I have experience in developing multithreaded program under both MacOS and WSL2 environment in school. In my past
internship at Dorabot Inc., I
engaged in developing a new Web API containing both front-end, REST services, and
a SQL database, as well as writing scripts for the CI/CD pipeline of the Gitlab repo,
which proved useful in ensuring the quality of the codes. Besides, I also gained
experience in testing software (unit test and integration test) using PyTest when I did
my software internship at Gizwits IoT Technology Co., Ltd. In addition, I implemented
a camera view frustum culling algorithm, a physic system and a navigation mesh system
in the game engine PrimeEngine developed by Artem Kovalovs, a principal graphics &
game programmer at Naughty Dog.
